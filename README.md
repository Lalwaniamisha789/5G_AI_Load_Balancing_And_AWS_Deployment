# 5G Traffic Prediction Using Machine Learning and Cloud Integration

## üöÄ Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic traffic load in 5G networks using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. With the explosive growth of real-time applications and connected devices, efficient resource allocation (bandwidth, latency, power) in 5G networks is critical. Our LSTM-based predictive model is trained on real-world Quality of Service (QoS) data to estimate future resource allocation needs and optimize network performance.

The trained model is deployed on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** to enable real-time, scalable, and cloud-native traffic prediction via a REST API.

## üß™ Implementation Pipeline

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Converted timestamps, normalized units (e.g., Kbps ‚Üí Mbps)
- Encoded categorical fields like `Application_Type`
- Normalized all features using Min-Max scaling

### 2. **Sequence Generation**
- Used sliding windows to create 10-step sequences for LSTM input

### 3. **Model Architecture**
- 2-layer LSTM with 64 hidden units
- Fully connected output layer with sigmoid activation

### 4. **Training**
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Early Stopping based on validation loss

### 5. **Evaluation**
- Metrics: MAE, MSE, R¬≤ Score  
- Visualized predicted vs. actual resource allocations

## üåê Cloud Deployment on AWS

To make the model accessible in real-world 5G environments:
- The trained LSTM model is **deployed on AWS EC2** using a Flask API.
- **AWS S3** is used to store preprocessed data and model weights.
- The REST API accepts JSON input and returns predicted bandwidth/resource allocation in real-time.

This deployment enables **edge device compatibility**, **on-demand predictions**, and **horizontal scalability**.
